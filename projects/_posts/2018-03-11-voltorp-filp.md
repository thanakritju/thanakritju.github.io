# Voltorp Flip
Long time ago, I played Pokemon Heart Gold on Nintendo DS. There was a mini game called Voltorp Filp. It was pretty interesting so I decided to create my own Voltorp Filp using Javascript.
In that time, I was studying in petroleum engineering degree. I had never been coding too much. This might be my very first project that introduces Javascipt and makes me love programing.


## How to play
Clone this project and open index.html or visit my demo [link](https://thanakritju.github.io/voltorp-flip)

## Rules
1. There is 25 cards with hidden values [0,1,2,3] with randomly distributed.
2. Every columns and rows informs total scores (with black text) and number of zeros (red text).
3. Rules are simple, your score will be calculated by the product of faced-up cards (Meaning that once you filped a 0-value card, you lost).
4. To win the game, you have to flip all non-zero-value cards.

## Todo
- Refactor the code after working in IT-related field for one year.
