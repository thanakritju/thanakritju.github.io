# Leetcode with Golang
After working with [Thoughtworks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/) and learning a lot about [TDD](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDrivenDevelopment.html) and writing clean code. Hoping into the world of competitive programing has been on my to-do list since forever. Why don't practice both of them at the same time? That is the starting point of the project. 

I chose [Golang](https://go.dev/) because I always wanted to learn this language as I don't get to use it in my day-to-day work. It turns out to be a good language for understanding algorithms because unless **C++** or **Python** that are quite popular in the field and come with strong standard libraries, you get to implement a lot of algorithms by yourself which is very rewarding.

I love writing the tests first before writing my code, not only because I wanted to practice TDD but it just makes the feedback loop a lot faster compared to when you submit to the [leetcode website](https://leetcode.com/). When you get rejected because you write your code wrongly, all you need to do is just adding another test case alongside with your test cases, you can confidently write/modify your code and make sure it does not break the existing ones without the need of resubmitting into the website again.

One thing I could have done it better about this project is that redoing the problems with different approaches, I tend to not come back to the problems that I have solved, I tend to treat it as a game or a mission that I need to solve, after finishing I feel accomplished and move on to the next puzzle, the same way as I play video games. I lost a lot of benefits in understanding problems better, finding faster solutions and truely master the algorithms. 

Second thing that I hope I can improve is trying to find best solution for a problem at very start, I should have started with a simple solution, understanding why it does not work in particular conditions and evolving the solution into a better one. The same way that you need to demonstrate in common tech interview.
